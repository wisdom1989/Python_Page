0,11/01/2023 19:03,"Just downloaded this recently and it looks like a great app that will do something valuable for me that most budgeting/personal finance apps don‚Äôt do, or don‚Äôt do well ‚Äî track ongoing expenses such as subscriptions. We all know these are becoming a bigger part of life. I love the fact this app isn‚Äôt subscription based itself! At least I don‚Äôt think it is. The premium features seem quite reasonably priced.

Just one big drawback for me. Why don‚Äôt you make an iPad version? It‚Äôs not hard and it would be a big selling point. Well it would for me; I‚Äôm disabled and in bed most of the time so I use an iPad Pro M1 12.9‚Äù rather than my dinky iPhone XS Max (heh). Those of us who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúon the go‚Äù really want and need the extra screen size of a tablet or a laptop. I have my phone on my bedside table for, you know, phone stuff.

I‚Äôm not taking away any stars because I want to encourage people to download your product and for you guys to keep having success. But please think about taking the app multi platform, at least to iPadOS. macOS would be great too, and have them all sync via iCloud for a given Apple ID and account (if it supports multiple accounts per user). Thanks!",5,FALSE,Y U NO LOVE iPAD??,Stageon,
1,18/10/2017 20:57,"The app is great, and I purchased the all-in-one pack as soon as I noticed this app‚Äôs utility. It‚Äôs really handy to have a central place to keep track of and see exactly where your money for subscriptions is going, as well as when and how much your next bill is going to be. I personally have multiple subscriptions to array of different services, and I never really realized the amount of money I was spending on them, but this app aims to solve that problem. Input all of your current subscriptions, and then you can easily have an overview of everything in one place and even audit the subscriptions you no longer need.

I applaud the developer for the work they‚Äôve done and the frequent updates they release! It‚Äôs no joke that they‚Äôre improving the app and adding new features all the time.

I highly recommend both the app and the in-app purchase‚Äîjust give it a try already‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!",5,FALSE,Very useful app & highly recommended,Nicolas Gomollon,
2,28/08/2018 21:30,"Love this app! It‚Äôs *almost* everything I‚Äôve been looking for in order to track upcoming expenses and bills. It‚Äôs clean, minimal, easy to use, has tons of built-in services to select from, but allows you to create your own custom ones as well. Just a few small suggestions that would make this app amazing.

- Upon initially launching, allow a user to just select all the subscription services first. This would make setup so much faster than having to search each one out and set it up one at a time. I actually entered all of mine *blank* to begin with just to get them all selected, then went back in and configured each one.

- Allow a preference to display the upcoming due date as either a relative span of time (2 weeks) or the actual date (Sept 15, 2018). Would much rather see the actual date. I actually used the Description field to simply add ‚Äú3rd, 11th, 21st, 30th‚Äù etc to indicate the date of the month that expense is due on.

- Add a Categories field. While I know the intent of the app is to track subscriptions, I‚Äôm actually using it to track expenses beyond that, including utilities, bills, etc., and I‚Äôd love to be able to put each expense into a category and view those lists either collectively, or separately.

Again, love the app, highly recommend it! Would love to see just a few small tweaks which would make it much more useful.",5,FALSE,"Fantastic app, clean, functional",marcusdiddle,
3,20/12/2019 08:02,"I found this app very highly productive and useful. Despite the fact that Bobby is a great app to use and have all your subscriptions in one place. However there‚Äôs a small adjustment that I think would make our user interface extremely better and steal the show! If Bobby offers us to have a built-in wallet in the app which we can use to store our funds which will be equivalent to the amount of cost of all our subscriptions every month, so that we never have to worry about moving funds in multiple accounts, it would make everything so much more easier. If this app keeps all the data of our subscriptions and pays for the subscriptions from the wallet automatically every month that‚Äôd be awesome!",5,FALSE,"Satisfied, yet minor adjustments needed.",David Tahir,

I‚Äôve had no problems with the app and one of my favorite things about it is it‚Äôs completely FREE, no subscriptions or payments to access main features.

A couple features that I would really love to see implemented is the ability to set a subscription as paid or unpaid for the month, as well as sort of grey out or ‚Äúdisable‚Äù any subscriptions that I may want to continue keeping track of but may not necessarily have active.

The only request that I could make is that for simplicity it would be nice to have like a little check circle/box that indicate that I paid that specific bill.

Three things I want to see added 1. Change the default ‚ÄúRemind me‚Äù setting. I have to manually change each one to what I would like to see. Not really a big deal, since once all of your subscriptions are setup, you shouldn‚Äôt have to touch them again. 2. Allow us to upload a custom icon for a service not listed.

9,23/09/2017 14:22,Simple to use that just plain gets the job done. 4 stars because there are a few features that could be enhanced as mentioned in other reviews but this was a solid addition overall to my financial management stable of apps. I use a different bill tracker app but this is perfect for those month to month or yearly subscriptions that we tend to forget about and keep renewing even though I mean to cancel them. Have already saved 10 times the cost of the app by using to cancel renewals ON TIME and having one place to track the ridiculous amount I spend on subs and account for all that lost money.

Would love if this were a more automatic process for paying customers. As it stands the app is updated very infrequently and this seems to be the only occasion where these new subscriptions are added.

Also, two bugs: it keeps wiping out subscriptions from the categories I‚Äôve created. And I believe the math is often wrong for the totals at the bottom.

And a lot of subscriptions change over time like Netflix.  Obviously this is an on boarding specific change but I think it would make it feel less friction.

Second thing is taxes, somehow... not sure how that would work... maybe just a setting somewhere during on boarding and/or on each subscription.  Some charge taxes, some don‚Äôt.

231,10/10/2017 15:43,"Bobby 2 is a clean, slick, simple way to keep track of all of your subscriptions. At a time when so many developers are switching to subscription models, it can be tough to keep each subscription‚Äôs cost and renewal dates straight. Having a simple-yet-beautiful place to go to view all of these is a bigger boon than you might think. The ability to show expense total by total or average for a monthly period, and the manual or automatic sorting options make it easy to quickly see what‚Äôs due soon or view your subscriptions how you need or want. 

The payment cycles when adding a subscription are completely customizable so whether that subscription renews every month, or every 4 weeks, your covered. Bobby 2 includes a lot of popular subscriptions already, from which you can add (Apple Music, Netflix, Dreamhost, even Ulysses and Overcast), and adding these will include the app/service icon. For other services, you can create a custom subscription entry with all of the same features, and then choose from a set of good looking icons, and the color picker. I was able to make my entry for Day One Premium match the shade of blue commonly used by Day One (more or less) and give it an icon close enough to represent what it‚Äôs for, and I was pretty satisfied with that. 

The app also offers a few icon selections for the home screen Icon, light and dark modes, and the ability to select from a few different fonts. While these, along with unlimited subscriptions, are behind an in-app purchase, the price is well worth it ‚Äî especially at the current $1.99, but even at the regular $3, it would be worth it if you have a lot of subscriptions to keep track of.

By using it, developers can provide customers with a specialized template for adding events to their calendar.  Users can then manage them in a way that is already familiar, as well as view and organize them in the context of other events.

Since Calendar is integrated with Reminders, users can associate subscriptions that require a money deposit before their due date with a reminder to do so.

iCal integration is better, too, even though both this app and the aforementioned stock apps use the same service. As both the maker of the Calendar and Reminders app, Apple is the better choice for storing your personal data.

Calendar and Reminder syncs events across all devices, and can share events with other users.

This is a clean app, I will be the first to admit. Its UI is flawless; it is bug-free; it has every element common to every good app (a feedback form and contact information); it understands a need, fully and competently; its update history reflects the  hallmark of worthy: a willingness to maintain an open line of communication with customers and to evolve the product in tandem with their needs.

I bought all the upgrades, and I believe they are a very small price to pay, a price that would be spent on forgetting about just one subscription! This app helps me clearly see and think about all the little costs I‚Äôm paying out each month.

I was thrilled when I first got it, and then it stopped working for a while, and I emailed the developers a bunch of times, increasingly annoyed. I had suggestions, but most importantly I wanted it to actually show up. Eventually I thought I had lost all my data, and then it all turned up again. Now it‚Äôs working flawlessly, and with the latest updates I can categorize all the subscriptions.

This app is not perfect. I am hoping that the developers will charge IAPs for ever more improvements (as they have been), Of course not all suggested features in these reviews are things I‚Äôd like to see (some of them are kind of loopy!).

It felt like Xmas in September. After doing a little homework, I‚Äôve come to glean that this dev is more ‚Äòcreative agency for hire‚Äô than ‚Äòapp suite developer‚Äô. Ergo, I hope for Yummygum‚Äôs sake that fans of this app appreciate how spoiled we are that this passion-project receives updates even a couple times per year.

That said, I do have a couple suggestions, which I‚Äôve tried as best I can (considering my rookie status at writing in Swift) to weigh against what I‚Äôd said earlier and knowing that clients paying more than $1.99 command more of their time than a Bobby user. Here are my suggestions:

- Integration of a color-picker or hex code input field for custom subscriptions
- Expanded icon selection (maybe sold as an expansion pack, consistent with their current price model)
- Expanded selection of subscription platforms and a dedicated email address for accepting subscription platform requests from users
- Localized calendar integration

Echoing a more glaring issue I‚Äôve seen (and which has been solidified) in other‚Äôs reviews, the notification system feels v inconsistent.
